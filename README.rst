Usage
=====

* Register the package at the ZCA via ZCML::

  <include package="icemac.recurrence" />

* Compute recurrences. The example computes the 2nd Tuesday each month.::

      >>> from icemac.recurrence import get_recurrences
      >>> get_recurrences(
      ...     datetime=datetime(2015, 10, 13, 11, 15),
      ...     period='nth weekday of month',
      ...     interval_start=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
      ...     interval_end=datetime(2015, 12, 31))
      [datetime(2015, 10, 13, 11, 15),
       datetime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 15),
       datetime(2015, 12, 8, 11, 15)]

* Supported recurrence periods:

  * ``daily``
  * ``weekly``
  * ``biweekly``
  * ``nth weekday of month``
  * ``nth weekday every other month``
  * ``nth weekday from end of month``
  * ``nth weekday from end of other month``
  * ``yearly``
